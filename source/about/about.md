This is a dev blog where I put what I want to take notes of and share with others for better goods. **#nostringattached** **#nothingserious** **#justchilling**

## Meh, who again?
My name is [Humphrey Sangtae Ahn](https://github.com/ahnsv), Boston College Class of 2019, supposed to be. Majored in Computer Science and Applied Psychology, double major. But now I'm in a gap year (actually years) for military service in South Korea. I'm serving as an Information System Management Specialist in ROK Air Force HQ, as a part of the Mobile App Development team. 

I'm into a variety of fields in modern programming. Of all those numerous things in programming, Web is my fav. Well, it's more like what I'm digging in. You know, modern Web ecosystem never stops, always changes so fast. I want to keep following what's new, prospective subfields, and what's next, and hopefully, this blog can help me and my fellow aspiring developer folks.

## So..., what is this page for

Look, *sharing is caring*. I'm gonna put what I've learned (maybe pretty much obvious things for many of you smart-ass guys) and if you liked it, plz leave some comments or share them with someone else. 

Plus, I'm gonna try to interpolate Korean contents for ma Korean bros and sises. **S/O to KOREA!!** Y'all gotta know how Korean developers are in need of supports. We have to take extra time and efforts to translate almost every dev doc we find, with lower income than folks in other countries. Despite all those disadvantages, there are a lot of amazing developers in Korea and I admire them.

ANYWAYS, this page is for me and other developers.

## Okay, cut the BS. Why should I care about you?

I think I am a mediocre programmer. One of many charms of programming and its ecosystem is that it humbles you. Acknowledging that s**tloads of people are better than you and they don't stop learning new things, I felt like I'm never going to catch them up. I still do. 

But I believe in [collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence). If I can share what I learn or get me inspired, you give me feedback, and I give you that back, it'd be awesome, wouldn't it? K? :wink:

## TL;DR
* Let's share some knowledge in this competitive world. Knowledge is the power.
* This ain't no serious BS. You can just read, and if you like it, plz thumbs up. Or, move the eff on.
